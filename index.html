                <p>
                    For a couple of years now, I have been fascinated with older papers and science fiction stories
                    about
                    emerging technologies. I believe they are helpful to understand how people were thinking about
                    technology in their own time and from their own perspective. Through part of this research, I
                    have
                    come to the term ‘Cyborgness’. While others have used it too , it does not have a distinct
                    definition. For this text I have defined it as the following:
                </p>
                <div>
                    <div class="tabbed">
                        <h3> Cyborgness (n.)</h3>
                        <div class="tabbed">
                            1. The state, condition, or quality of being a cyborg; cybernetic organism.
                            <br><br>
                            2. The connection and extension of the human through technology.
                            <br><br>
                            3. The integration and inability of separation between humans and their creations.
                            <br><br>
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    Considering this definition, all of us are — and have been — infused with Cyborgness for a long
                    time
                    now. Ever since we invented the first tools, we have created a dependency on them. Without
                    technology, would we know what to do with ourselves? As American author and professor Donna
                    Haraway
                    says in her essay ‘A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the
                    1980s’: ‘High-tech culture challenges…dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and
                    who
                    is made in the relation between human and machine’. Today, what is making us slowly more cyborg
                    than
                    human is the connection we have with technology and to each other through it. Our tools have
                    become
                    more than just technology, and our technology has become more than just our tools, they have
                    become
                    extensions of ourselves, of humanity. This is what British essayist and historian Thomas Carlyle
                    wrote about machinery in 1829: ‘These things...indicate a mighty change in our whole manner of
                    existence. For the same habit regulates not our modes of action alone, but our modes of thought
                    and
                    feeling. Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand.’ To me it sounds as
                    if
                    two hundred years ago Carlyle already understood the influence machinery/tools/technology would
                    have
                    on human beings collectively.
                    <br><br>Another aspect of my research made me question why I have a much easier time reading a
                    science
                    fiction story than a scientific text. Why is it that I can read John Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or
                    There
                    and Back Again (1937) in less than a week, but can barely get started on some theoretical texts,
                    which are often much shorter than an entire book. I assume this has to do with the writing
                    style,
                    and because stories give you something to care about, a character, a problem and a journey. At
                    the
                    end of the journey, the characters will have changed, learned a lesson or succeeded in
                    accomplishing
                    their goal.
                    <br><br>That is why I decided to write this thesis with a more story-like writing style, while
                    still
                    containing my research and references. During the tale that follows I aim to shed light on how
                    our
                    understanding of the connection between human and machine has evolved since the 1800s,
                    particularly
                    within science fiction, and how it influences the way we think about Cyborgness in the present
                    day.
                    When I talk about science fiction, I do not necessarily mean the kind with spaceships, laser
                    guns
                    and teleporters. I am talking about stories that use science and fiction to critically reflect
                    on
                    technology, on how we use it and the effect it has on us and the world around us. By imagining
                    what
                    could be done with new technologies in a creative way, writers of the past have often had pretty
                    good assumptions of what the world could look like today. This is how Bruce Sterling, American
                    science fiction author, worded it in 1986 in the preface of William Gibson’s Burning Chrome:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="tabbed">
                        <i>Science-fiction writers are...court jesters. We are Wise Fools who can leap, caper, utter
                            prophecies, and scratch ourselves in public. We can play with Big Ideas because the garish
                            motley of our pulp origins makes us seem harmless. ...we have influence without
                            responsibility.
                            Very few feel obliged to take us seriously, yet our ideas permeate the culture bubbling
                            along
                            invisibility, like background radiation.
                        </i>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Science fiction writers have a special place in history. No one has to take them seriously, but
                    in
                    the meantime they have the most critical and wild thoughts about the present day, and they reach
                    a
                    large audience. They are the ones who make their readers think about the influence and effect of
                    emerging technologies. Sterling also says in the same preface ‘we see a future that is
                    recognisably
                    and painstakingly drawn from the modern condition’, further specifying that Gibson’s science
                    fiction
                    tales are not some wild speculation about the future, but a commentary on the then-present.
                    <br><br>Now without further ado, let us get into a conversation between two people where one
                    will
                    teach
                    the other what it means to be human, what it means to be cyborg and how to engage with the
                    technology that is all around us through the use of a bit of science fiction.

                    As I looked around, I found myself surrounded by pine trees and mountains with summits covered
                    in
                    snow. All around the misty mountains disappeared in the distance. No one else was here. I
                    directed
                    myself upwards the mountain, up the steep hill and across the lightly paved out path. I could
                    hear
                    the wind whipping past me, soft snow falling against the rocks and the chirping of birds playing
                    in
                    my ears. I enjoyed the sereness of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Somewhere through all the sounds, I heard a knock against my window.
                    <br><br>
                    Exiting the virtual environment, I came back to my apartment. Rain was pelting against the
                    window
                    and the occasional thunder could be heard. And there, within the rain, was a figure, knocking on
                    my
                    window.
                    <br><br>
                    ‘Thanks,’ she said, ‘can I come inside?’
                    <br><br>
                    I nodded, and before I could say anything more, she was standing right in front of me. I offered
                    her
                    some dry clothes and a cup of hot tea. We sat down in my small living room. On my computer the
                    simulation of Chamounix was still running. She looked at it while considering what to say.
                    <br><br>
                    'Ever actually been there? Like, not virtually.’ She questioned. I shook my head.
                    <br><br>
                    ‘It’s quite a sight to behold. The air up there is fresh, and the feeling of the wind in your
                    hair
                    is absolutely awesome. If you have the chance, you should really go out there.’
                    <br><br>
                    I looked at her doubtfully and told her it was an area near Mont Blanc. She was looking at my
                    mostly
                    empty shelves. Most of my literature wasn't on there, I didn’t own that many paper copies
                    anymore.
                    There were some trinkets, a wine glass I forgot to put away and an old paper copy of
                    Frankenstein I
                    was gifted by an old friend a long time ago, though I had not touched it since.
                    <br><br>
                    'Have you ever read Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus?’ She asked. I shook my head again,
                    questioning if I should have. Why I would have.
                    <br><br>
                    'It is this novel written in 1818 (revised in 1831) by Mary Shelley about how far technology
                    could
                    go, and the imagining of a ghost-story with her friends. Yet it is so much more than that. Dr
                    Frankenstein gave life to a body constructed of several different corpses through the use of
                    electricity. The creation was supposed to be beautiful, given life through technology and
                    science,
                    and a new step in science and alchemy. But instead, horrified by what he had done, he turned
                    away
                    from his creation and cursed it for being alive, while it was Frankenstein who had created him.
                    I
                    think the story of Dr Frankenstein and his creation is incredibly important for how we think
                    about
                    technology and ourselves nowadays, as it is very similar to the circumstances we find ourselves
                    in
                    today.
                    In a way, we are both the doctor and the creature he created. Because we made technology, we are
                    connected to and through it. When we realise how much control this technology has over our lives
                    we
                    are horrified and try to turn away from it. That is the moment when we find that we cannot, we
                    are
                    connected and cannot get ourselves to get completely rid of it. We even went one step further
                    than
                    the doctor and connected our creation so deeply into our lives and ourselves, that if you took
                    it
                    away, we would struggle to function. We can only try to be more aware of how we engage with it.
                    In
                    the end Frankenstein decided to let his creation live, as we are also still living with ours
                    every
                    single day.
                    You could also say we are both the creator, the creation, and the connection, and because of
                    that we
                    are on our way to becoming true cyborgs. Though we are not there quite yet. It is important to
                    keep
                    in mind that being cyborg does not mean that you are no longer human. A cyborg is the extended
                    human, the connected human, the one who cannot separate from technology. The term cyborg was
                    first
                    defined by Austrian scientist and inventor Manfred Clynes and American scientist Nathan Kline in
                    Cyborgs and Space in 1960 as an organism that purposefully extends themselves using external
                    components to adapt to new environments. In that time, they were talking about space travel.
                    Today,
                    we can see the Internet as one of these environments. Just think about how well acquainted you
                    are
                    with your phone. When the battery dies it’s almost as if you lose one of your limbs, that is how
                    used you are to it always being there. Where will you go when Google Maps can’t guide you
                    anymore?
                    Around the same time, American psychologist and computer scientist Joseph Licklider in said the
                    following in his article ‘Man-Computer Symbiosis’:
                    <br><br>

                    had
                    the following to say about that:

                            actions. Everyday millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control

                I told her I think I am starting to understand, but that there were a lot of questions forming.
                <br><br>
                What did it mean to be cyborg? Was it good or bad, or something in between? Or somehow both and
                neither at the same time? Was I both human and machine? Where did the differences lie, and what
                are
                the important ones? Was I slowly becoming more machine than human, and would that really be that
                bad?
                <br><br>
                I was also thinking of something I had read in British computer scientist Alan Turing’s
                ‘Computing
                Machinery and Intelligence’. He wrote in 1950: ‘The claim that “machines cannot make mistakes”
                seems
                a curious one. One is tempted to retort, “Are they any worse for that?”’ If I was both human and
                machine, would I not make mistakes anymore? Would I make them with purpose? Or are mistakes so
                inherently human that even if I became more machine than human I would not stop making them?
                <br><br>
                ‘Alright, let us move on then,’ she said, breaking my train of thought and asked, ‘now that you
                know
                more about what it means to become cyborg, have you ever heard of the short story ‘The Machine
                Stops’?’
                <br><br>
                Again, I shook my head, I had never even heard of this one. She took this as a cue to start her
                monologuing again.
                <br><br>
                ‘The Machine Stops was written by E M Forster in 1909 about a world totally connected and
                controlled
                by the Machine. Everyone lives alone in a hexagonal room with a bed, a desk and the Book of the
                Machine. They needed nothing more. Every day they spend thinking of thoughts of other people
                that
                have thought of others' thoughts, in honour of the Machine. There are two characters we get to
                know,
                Vashti who is totally enraptured by the Machine and basically worships it as one would a godlike
                entity. The second character is Kuno, her son, who wants to break free from the Machine.
                Most things Kuno said rung true with me. In their first conversation in the story, Vashti and
                Kuno
                are having a conversation through purple glowing disks, with which they can see each other. Kuno
                is
                asking his mother to come and see him in real life, to discuss his hopes and dreams for the
                future.
                He also voices some dislike towards the Machine. After she refuses to meet him, he isolates
                himself
                after saying this:

                “I want to see you not through the Machine,” said Kuno. “I want to speak to you not through some
                wearisome Machine.” ... “Men made it, do not forget that. Great men, but men. The Machine is
                much,
                but it is not everything. I see something like you in this plate, but I do not see you. I hear
                something like you through this telephone, but I do not hear you.

                This is something that can very easily be translated to the devices we use for communication
                today,
                such as our phones and laptops. I feel like it is often found to be more honest to have a
                serious
                conversation, confession, or any sort of heart-to-heart face to face, without the barrier of a
                phone
                in between. That way emotions can be better read, the tonality of the voice is clearer and eye
                contact is actually really there.
                The most wondrous thing, for me, is that this concept most of us are experiencing every day was
                already foreseen in 1909. While landline phones did exist in 1909, it was not yet possible to
                call
                over longer distances, let alone see the person you are calling. The sound quality was also
                incomparable to what we have now. Even with all the modern-day improvements to
                telecommunication,
                Kuno's statements about “seeing someone through the Machine” still ring true. What’s more, our
                sense
                of each other has both been extended and compromised due to technology. And so has our sense of
                space. As Kuno expresses to Vashti:
                <br><br><i>
                    <div class="tabbed">
                        You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say ‘space is annihilated,’ but we have
                        annihilated not space, but that sense thereof. We have lost part of ourselves.
                </i><br><br>
            </div>
            And:
            <br><br><i>
                <div class="tabbed">
                    We created the Machine...It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch,
                    it
                    has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed
                    our
                    bodies and our wills.
            </i><br><br>
        </div>
        The whole world has been reduced to the palm of our hand or the size of an open book, and made
        accessible from basically anywhere within that world. On one hand this connection is wonderful,
        on
        the other it is changing how we interact, feel and think. The question is whether it is for
        better
        or for worse.
        Interestingly, after describing how their world has become unfit for athletes, Kuno says “Man
        must
        be adapted to his surroundings, must he not?” If I didn't know any better, I would think he was
        referring to Clynes and Kline’s definition of the cyborg. Except, that definition was developed
        about fifty years after Forster’s short story was published. This means that Forster not only
        anticipated the way we are now connected; to the whole wide world through the Internet, our
        mobile
        devices and social media platforms, but already saw that we would be adapting to this new world
        by
        extending ourselves through technology.
        Technology, especially the Internet, has influence over every part of our life. It is the medium
        through which we learn and discover, it determines the way we interact with people, it is where
        we
        find entertainment. At the same time, it is messing with our sense of place, scale and quantity,
        the
        way we perceive the world around us. This is because everything gets narrowed down to the size
        of
        our hands or to a number. The likes on the things we post, the amount of followers we have, the
        views we get, we see the whole world on a little tiny screen. While we are more connected to
        each
        other than ever before, at the same time it has become so easy to become disconnected from the
        world
        we live in.
        Not only has technology taken our sense of place in this world, but it has also gotten inside
        our
        heads. A whole new world lies beyond the screen, people to interact with, sights to see, things
        to
        experience, stories to read, reality or fiction, good or bad. In ‘The Machine Stops’ it even
        goes
        one step further, stating: “but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient,
        that
        they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine.” Meaning that, on the scale
        from
        human to machine, where cyborg lies perfectly at the centre, most characters in Forster’s story
        are
        almost fully on the machine's side. They have become so distant from what makes them human, they
        lost any sense of self, that human is not a name that fits them anymore.
        Earlier, when Kuno tells his mother about his first escape attempt back to the surface of the
        Earth
        he remarks:
        <br><br><i>
            <div class="tabbed">
                I felt that humanity existed, ...and all these tubes and buttons and machineries neither
                came
                into the world with us, nor will they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we
                are
                here.
        </i><br><br>
    </div>
    This statement has been very comforting to me, and I think is important to keep in mind about
    technology. Technology is great. It has done so much for us, improved our lives in so many ways.
    But
    when it ends, my life and yours, it will probably not matter significantly. Your online self
    will
    not follow you out, nor will your tech itself. They will stay behind, living on forever,
    immortalising you. Until someone, somehow, completely deletes it of the internet and you die
    again,
    completely forgotten this time.’

            We sat in silence for a bit after that.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, I asked if we still use science fiction today to reflect on technology.
            <br><br>
            ‘That's an interesting one,’ she answered, ‘of course we do, though I think it is important to
            note
            that science fiction today is a little bit different than that of a hundred years ago. Then,
            science
            fiction primarily happened in the written form of books. Today that written form still exists,
            although it shows and expresses itself in many different types of media, from books to film to
            TV
            series to podcasts to games, and music. As long as it critically reflects on emerging
            technologies
            it can be science fiction.
            <br><br>
            Though for now, I want to focus on a short story by American writer and game designer Julian K
            Jarboe, since in it they reflect on a specific can of worms that the internet has opened for us.
            The
            story is called ‘"The Only Innocent Man”’ and follows Charlie, teacher and former poster of
            stories
            on the early Internet. He used to write softcore romance stories, always soft and sweet, and
            always
            between two men, one cis and the other transgender.
            One of his students finds his old stories and asks Charlie about them. Not liking this one bit,
            Charlie brings into question whether he and who he used to be, have a right to be forgotten for
            the
            things he did over a decade ago. Or does he belong to the enormous archive that is the Internet,
            where he shared himself freely, so he can forever be viewed by others who find solace in his
            stories? Do these strangers have a right to know him, or at least, who he used to be?
            Harari remarks the following in Homo Deus: “A friend once told me that what she fears most about
            growing old is becoming irrelevant, turning into a nostalgic old woman who cannot understand the
            world around her, or contribute much to it.”
            Charlie and Harari's friend are two sides of the same coin. On one side, there is the fear of
            being
            forgotten, having no legacy and leaving nothing behind, and on the other side there is the right
            to
            be forgotten, to be unknown and totally out of the spotlight that social media constantly shines
            upon us. The existence of the Internet has been so normalised that a lot of people do not
            question
            the way we interact with it and give it all of who we are. We can hardly imagine a world anymore
            without the knowledge of the world literally at our fingertips, guiding us through life. Charlie
            expresses his feelings about the double-edged sword that is the Internet like this:
            <br><br><i>
                <div class="tabbed">
                    You encounter two devils...: the one you know and the one you don’t. Desiring to express
                    yourselves and connect with others, you and millions of people enter their most personal
                    thoughts, feelings, and life events into databases. Everything you create is private
                    property,
                    and you are not its owner. ...Choose your devil carefully, and be aware that if you die in

        The Internet offers you connection to knowledge and to other like-minded people. In exchange
        They,
        with a capital T, get to look into your soul, They get to know the deepest parts of you, and get
        to
        keep you and all that you are. When you dance with the devil, you have to live with the
        consequences
        when he puts you in the spotlight. In 1998 Canadian Artist David Rokeby wrote the article ‘The
        Construction of Experience: Interface as Content’, and in it he writes:
        <br><br><i>
            <div class="tabbed">
                The tricks of today’s artists and hackers are the commercial tools of tomorrow. Perhaps more
                significantly, with the explosive growth of the internet, these sleights-of-hand are
                becoming
                incorporated into communications systems, and by implication, into our social fabric.
                Whether we
                intend it or not, we’re redesigning the ways that we experience the world and each other.
        </i><br><br>
    </div>
    We now have redesigned the way we experience the world and each other. The biggest question is
    if
    this has been a good call. We have become fluent in our connection to and through the Internet.
    Most
    of the time it is incredibly easy to forget that it has not always been like that. The Internet
    has
    been so normalised. This is not necessarily a new intricacy; it happens every time a new
    technology
    is introduced to the world. Carlyle, in 1829, wrote this about machinery:
    <br><br><i>
        <div class="tabbed">
            To us who live in the midst of all this, and see continually the faith, hope and, practice
            of
            everyone founded on Mechanism of one kind or other, it is apt to seem quite natural, and as
            if
            it could never have been otherwise.”
    </i><br><br></div>
    Often new technologies are, after first being opposed to, quickly accepted and adapted into
    society.
    Where there are emerging technologies, there are luddites; people opposed to new technologies or
    ways of working. With the rise of machinery, they were afraid that the machines would steal
    their
    jobs, when photography was introduced they were afraid there was no use anymore for painting,
    when
    typewriters became accessible they were afraid kids would not learn how to write by hand
    anymore,
    with the rise of the internet they feared there would be no need to learn anything anymore, and
    now
    artificial intelligence will steal their jobs again.
    Yet it all always turned out fine. Right?’

            The rain started to clear up, though puddles of water still covered the streets. Slowly, the

            alternative destinies. Of course, this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by
            the
            past. But some freedom is better than none.” Start using science fiction, not to predict to
            future,
            but to actively and creatively engage with technology.
            I cannot definitively say whether technology is good or bad, because it is neither. Just like
            humans
            are not inherently good or bad. It is wholly dependent on how we engage with it.
            Do not forget that you are on your way to becoming a fully equipped cyborg. There is not much
            you
            can do about it and maybe you are already there. No need to be afraid, for it does not have to
            be a
            bad thing. You are somewhere on the scale between being human and cyborg. Be aware to not let
            technology take control of your life.
            It is important to remember that a cyborg, as Donna Haraway redefined it her 1985 Manifesto for
            Cyborgs, is “a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social
            reality
            as well as a creature of fiction”.
            You cannot be cyborg without also being human, and every human has a bit of cyborgness in them.
            The
            two are not mutually exclusive; they go hand in hand. You cannot be one without the other. The
            only
            thing you have to watch out for is not to sell your soul on the way.
            And to conclude with one last quote from Carlyle:
            <br><br><i>
                <div class="tabbed">
                    But though Mechanism, wisely contrived, has done much for man in a social and moral point of
                    view, we cannot be persuaded that it has ever been the chief source of his worth or
                    happiness.

            As I looked around, I found myself surrounded by pine trees and mountains with summits covered
            in
            snow. All around misty mountains disappeared in the distance. Looking to the left, there she
            was, by
            my side again. Other people were here too, on the same path up the Mont Blanc, wearing brightly
            coloured jackets to protect them from the cold. I carefully climbed up the mountain, up the
            steep
            hill and across the heavily used path. I felt the wind in my hair and crisp coldness on my skin,
            heard the crackling of snow underneath my feet and the chirping of birds in the trees.
            Through the woods we could see the Mont Blanc, while enjoying the feeling of the morning sun
            upon
            our skin and that of her hand in mine.
            <br><br>
            It felt so real.
