<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
</center>
For a couple years now, I have been fascinated with older papers and science fiction stories about emerging technologies. I believe they are helpful to understand how people were thinking about technology in their own time and from their own perspective. Through part of this research I have reached the term ‘Cyborgness’. While others have used it too, it does not have a distinct definition. For this text I have defined it as the following:

<pre><h3>   Cyborgness (n.)</h3>
    1. The state, condition, or quality of being a cyborg; cybernetic organism. 

    2. The connection and extension of the human through technology. 

    3. The integration and inability of separation between the human and their creation.
<br><br></pre>

With this definition all of us are, and have been, infused with Cyborgness for a long while now. Ever since we invented the first tools, we have created a dependency on them. Of course we have, they make life easier and give us more freedom. As American author and professor Donna Haraway says in her essay ‘A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s’: ‘High-tech culture challenges...dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine’  Today, what is making us slowly more cyborg than human is the connection we have with technology, and to each other through it. Our tools have become more than just technology, and our technology has become more than just our tools, they have become extensions of ourselves, of humanity. This is what British essayist and historian Thomas Carlyle wrote about machinery (which I believe belongs on the same list as tools and technology) in 1829: ‘These things...indicate a mighty change in our whole manner of existence. For the same habit regulates not our modes of action alone, but our modes of thought and feeling. Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand.’  To me it sounds like, two hundred years ago, he already understood the influence machinery/tools/technology would have on human beings collectively. 
The other part of my research made me question why I have a much easier time reading a science fiction story than a scientific text. Why is it that I can read John Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or There and Back Again (1937) in less than a week, but can I barely get started on some theoretical texts, which are often way shorter than a whole book. I assume this has to do with the writing style, and because stories give you something to care about, a character, a problem and a journey. At the end of the journey, they will have changed, learned a lesson or succeeded in accomplishing their goal. 
That is how I decided to write this thesis with some story elements, trying to convey a more story-like writing style, while still containing my research and references. During this tale I aim to bring light to how our understanding of the connection between human and machine has evolved since the 1800s, and how it influences the way we think about Cyborgness in the present day, with the use of science fiction. When I talk about science fiction, I do not necessarily mean the kind with spaceships, laser guns and teleporters. I am talking about stories of any media which uses science and fiction to critically reflect on technology. Reflecting on how we use it, the effect it is having on us and the world around us. By imagining what could be done with new technologies in a creative way, writers of the past often have had pretty good assumptions of what the world could look like now. This is how Bruce Sterling, American science fiction author, worded it in 1986 in the preface of William Gibson’s Burning Chrome: 
<br><br>
<i>Science-fiction writers are...court jesters. We are Wise Fools who can leap, caper, utter prophecies, and scratch ourselves in public. We can play with Big Ideas because the garish motley of our pulp origins makes us seem harmless. ...we have influence without responsibility. Very few feel obliged to take us seriously, yet our ideas permeate the culture bubbling along invisibility, like background radiation. 
</i>
<br><br>
Science fiction writers have a special place in history. No one has to take them seriously, but in the meantime, they have the most critical and wild thoughts about the present day, and they have an audience. They are the ones to make their readers think about the influence and effect of emerging technologies. Sterling also says in the same preface ‘we see a future that is recognisably and painstakingly drawn from the modern condition.’ 
Further specifying  that Gibson’s science fiction tales are not some wild speculation of the future, but a commentary on the then-present.
Now without further ado, let us get into a conversation between two people where one will teach the other what it means to be human, what it means to be cyborg and how to engage with the technology that is all around us through the use of a bit of science fiction.

<h2>The Creator’s Connection to their Creation</h2>
</center>
</div>
<div>
As I looked around, I found myself surrounded by pine trees and mountains with summits covered in snow. All around the misty mountains disappeared in the distance. No one else was here. I directed myself upwards the mountain, up the steep hill and across the lightly paved out path. I could hear the wind whipping past me, a soft falling snow falling against the rocks and the chirping of birds playing in my ears. I enjoyed the sereness of it. 
<br><br>
Somewhere through all the sounds, I heard a knock against my window.
<br><br>
Exiting the virtual environment, I came back to my apartment. Rain was pelting against the window and the occasional thunder could be heard. And there, within the rain, was a figure, knocking on my window. 
<br><br>
‘Thanks,’ she said, ‘can I come inside?’ 
<br><br>
I nodded, and before I could say anything more, she was standing right in front of me. I offered her some dry clothes and a cup of hot tea. We sat down in my small living room. On my computer the simulation of Chamounix was still running. She looked at it while considering what to say. 
<br><br>
'Ever actually been there? Like, not virtually.’ She questioned. I shook my head.
<br><br>
‘It’s quite a sight to behold. The air up there is fresh, and the feeling of the wind in your hair is absolutely awesome. If you have the chance, you should really go out there.’
<br><br>
I looked at her doubtfully and told her it was an area near Mont Blanc. She was looking at my mostly empty shelves. Most of my literature wasn't on there, I didn’t own that many paper copies anymore. There were some trinkets, a wine glass I forgot to put away and an old paper copy of Frankenstein I was gifted by an old friend a long time ago, though I had not touched it since. 
<br><br>
'Have you ever read Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus?’ She asked. I shook my head again, questioning if I should have. Why I would have.
<br><br>
'It is this novel written in 1818 (revised in 1831) by Mary Shelley about how far technology could go, and the imagining of a ghost-story with her friends. Yet it is so much more than that. Dr Frankenstein gave life to a body constructed of several different corpses through the use of electricity. The creation was supposed to be beautiful, given life through technology and science, and a new step in science and alchemy. But instead, horrified by what he had done, he turned away from his creation and cursed it for being alive.  While it was Frankenstein who had created him. I think the story of Dr Frankenstein and his creation is incredibly important for how we think about technology and ourselves nowadays, as it is very similar to the circumstance we find ourselves in today. 
In a way, we are both the doctor and the creature he created. Because we made technology, we are connected to and through it. When we realise how much control this technology has over our lives we are horrified and try to turn away from it. That is the moment when we find that we cannot, we are connected and cannot get ourselves to get completely rid of it. We can only try to be more aware of how we engage with it. We even went one step further than the doctor and connected our creation so deeply into our lives and ourselves, that if you took it away, we would struggle to function. In the end he decide to let his creation live, as we are also still living with ours every single day. 
You could also say we are both the creator, the creation, and the connection, and because of that we are on our way to becoming true cyborgs. Though we are not there quite yet. It is important to keep in mind that being cyborg does not mean that you are no longer human. A cyborg is the extended human, the connected human, the one who cannot separate from technology. The term cyborg was first defined by Austrian scientist and inventor Manfred Clynes and American scientist Nathan Kline in Cyborgs and Space in 1960 as an organism that purposefully extends themselves using external components to adapt to new environments . In that time, they were talking about space travel. Today, we can see the Internet as one of these environments. Just think about how well acquainted you are with your phone. When the battery dies it’s almost as if you lose one of your limbs, that is how used you are to it always being there. Where will you go when Google Maps can’t guide you anymore?
American psychologist and computer scientist Joseph Licklider in 1960 said the following in his article ‘Man-Computer Symbiosis’: 
The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know exist today.  
That is you and me, my friend, we have become what Licklider hoped for. We have the knowledge of the world at our fingertips, we operate machines in ways that Licklider could only dream of. You are so connected and so efficient, it’s wonderful. Right?
Let’s see what Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli historian and author of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2017) has to say about that:
<br><br><i>
Merging with robots and computers...is already happening right now, through innumerable mundane actions. Everyday millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives. ...In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human. 
</i><br><br>
It is a warning. How far will you go, what parts of you will you willingly give to technology? We are more connected than any previous generation, but at what cost? Where does the threshold between human, cyborg and machine lie?’

<h2>The Duality of the Machine</h2>
</center>
</div>
<div>
I told her I think I am starting to understand, but that there were a lot of questions forming.
<br><br>
‘Alright, let us move on then.’ She said, then asked ‘Now that you know more about what it means to be becoming cyborg, have you ever heard of the short story ‘The Machine Stops’?’
<br><br>
Again, I shook my head, I had never even heard of this one. She took this as a cue to start her monologuing again.
<br><br>
‘The Machine Stops was written by E M Forster in 1909 about a world totally connected and controlled by the Machine. Everyone lives alone in a hexagonal room with a bed, a desk and the Book of the Machine. They needed nothing more. Every day they spend thinking of thoughts of other people that have thought of others' thoughts, in honour of the Machine. There are two characters we get to know, Vashti who is totally enraptured by the Machine and basically worships it as one would a godlike entity. The second character is Kuno, her son, who wants to break free from the Machine. 
Most things Kuno said rung true through me. In their first conversation in the story, Vashti and Kuno are conversing through purple glowing disks, with which they can see each other. Kuno is asking his mother to come and see him in real life, to discuss his hopes and dreams for the future. He also voices some dislike towards the Machine. After she refuses to meet him, he isolates himself after saying this:

“I want to see you not through the Machine,” said Kuno. “I want to speak to you not through some wearisome Machine.” ... “Men made it, do not forget that. Great men, but men. The Machine is much, but it is not everything. I see something like you in this plate, but I do not see you. I hear something like you through this telephone, but I do not hear you. 

This is something that can very easily be translated to the devices we use for communication today, such as our phones and laptops. Often it is found to be more honest to have a serious conversation, confession, or any sort of heart-to-heart face to face, without the barrier of a phone in between.
The most wondrous thing, for me, is that this is a concept most of us are experiencing today, was already foreseen in 1909. While landline phones did exist in 1909, it was not yet possible to call over longer distances and forget being able to see the one you were calling. The sound quality was also way worse than the worst we have now. Even with all the modern-day improvements to telecommunication, Kuno's statements about “seeing someone through the Machine” still ring true. Though, not only our sense of each other has been compromised due to technology, but also our sense of space. As Kuno expresses to Vashti:
<br><br><i>
You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say ‘space is annihilated,’ but we have annihilated not space, but that sense thereof. We have lost part of ourselves. 
</i><br><br>
And:
<br><br><i>
We created the Machine...It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills. 
</i><br><br>
The whole world has been reduced to the palm of our hand or the size of an open book, and made accessible from basically anywhere within that world.
-
Interestingly, after describing how their world has become unfit for athletes, Kuno says “Man must be adapted to his surroundings, must he not?”  If I didn't know any better, I would think he was referencing Clynes and Kline’s definition of the cyborg. Except, that definition was defined about fifty years after Forster’s short story was published. Which means that Forster not only anticipate the way we are now connected to the whole wide world, but already saw that we would be adapting to this new world through adapting, extending, ourselves through technology.
Technology has influence over every part of our life. It is the place where we learn and discover, it determines the way we interact with people, it is where we find entertainment. At the same time, it is messing with our sense of space, scale and quantity, it narrows everything down to a number. While we are more connected to each other than ever before, at the same time it has become so easy to become disconnected from reality. 
Not only has technology taken our sense of space in this world, but also inside our own heads. A whole new world lies beyond the screen, people to interact with, sights to see, things to experience, stories to read, reality or fiction, good or bad. In ‘The Machine Stops’ it even goes one step further, stating: “but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine.”  Meaning that, on the scale from human to machine, where cyborg lies perfectly at the centre, they are almost fully on the machine's side. They have become so distant from the human condition, lost any sense of self, that human is not a name that fits them anymore. 
Earlier, when Kuno tells his mother about his first escape attempt back to the surface of the Earth he remarks this:
<br><br><i>
I felt that humanity existed, ...and all these tubes and buttons and machineries neither came into the world with us, nor will they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we are here. 
</i><br><br>
This statement has been very comforting to me, and I think is important to keep in mind about technology. It is great. It has done so much for us, improved our lives in so many ways. But when it ends, my life and yours, it will not matter significantly, probably. Your online self will not follow you out, nor will your tech itself. They will stay behind, living on forever, immortalising you. Until someone, somehow, completely deletes it of the internet and you die again, completely forgotten this time.’

<h2>Welcome to the Internet</h2> 
</center>
</div>
<div>
We sat in silence for a bit after that.
<br><br>
Eventually, I asked if we still use science fiction today to reflect on technology. 
<br><br>
‘That's an interesting one,’ she answered, ‘of course we do, though I think it is important to note that science fiction today is a little bit different than that of a hundred years ago. Then, science fiction primarily happened in the written form of books. Today that written form still exist, although it shows and expresses itself in many different types of media, from books to film to TV series to podcasts to games, and music. As long as it critically reflects on emerging technologies it can be science fiction. The line between science fiction and science fact are blurring. 
<br><br>
Though for now, I want to focus on a short story by American writer and game designer Julian K Jarboe, since in it they reflect on a specific can of worms that the internet has opened for us. The story is called ‘"The Only Innocent Man”’ and follows Charlie, teacher and former poster of stories on the early Internet. He used to write softcore romance stories, always soft and sweet, and always between two men, one cis and the other transgender. 
One of his students finds his old stories and asks Charlie about them. Not liking this one bit, Charlie brings into question whether he and who he used to be, have a right to be forgotten for the things he did over a decade ago. Or does he belong to the enormous archive that is the Internet, where he shared himself freely, so he can forever be viewed by others who find solace in his stories? Do these strangers have a right to know him, or at least, who he used to be?
Harari remarks the following in Homo Deus: “A friend once told me that what she fears most about growing old is becoming irrelevant, turning into a nostalgic old woman who cannot understand the world around her, or contribute much to it.”   A little bit later he follows this up with: “You cannot count on death to save you from becoming completely irrelevant” 
Charlie and Harari's friend are two sides of the same coin. On one side, there is the fear of being forgotten, having no legacy and leaving nothing behind, and on the other side there is the right to be forgotten, to be unknown and totally out of the spotlight that social media constantly shines upon us. The existence of the Internet has been so normalised that no one questions the way we interact with it and give it all of who we are. We can hardly imagine a world anymore without the knowledge of the world literally at our fingertips, guiding us through life. Charlie expresses his feelings about the double-edged sword that is the Internet like this:
<br><br><i>
You encounter two devils...: the one you know and the one you don’t. Desiring to express yourselves and connect with others, you and millions of people enter their most personal thoughts, feelings, and life events into databases. Everything you create is private property, and you are not its owner. ...Choose your devil carefully, and be aware that if you die in the cloud—which is only, after all, someone else’s computer—you may die in real life. 
</i><br><br>
The Internet offers you connection to knowledge and to other like-minded people. In exchange they get to look into your soul, get to know to deepest parts of you, and get to keep you and all that you are. When you dance with the devil, you have to live with the consequences when he puts you in the spotlight. In 1998 Canadian Artist David Rokeby wrote his article ‘The Construction of Experience: Interface as Content’, and in it he writes:
<br><br><i>
The tricks of today’s artists and hackers are the commercial tools of tomorrow. Perhaps more significantly, with the explosive growth of the internet, these sleights-of-hand are becoming incorporated into communications systems, and by implication, into our social fabric. Whether we intend it or not, we’re redesigning the ways that we experience the world and each other. 
</i><br><br>
We now have redesigned the way we experience the world and each other. The biggest question is if this has been a good call. We have become fluent in our connection to and through the Internet. Most of the time it is incredibly easy to forget that it has not always been like that. The Internet has been so normalised. This is not necessarily a new intricacy, it happens every time a new technology is introduced to the world. Carlyle, in 1829, wrote this about machinery: 
<br><br><i>
To us who live in the midst of all this, and see continually the faith, hope and, practice of everyone founded on Mechanism of one kind or other, it is apt to seem quite natural, and as if it could never have been otherwise.” 
</i><br><br>
Often new technologies are, after first being opposed to, quickly accepted and adapted into society. Where there are emerging technologies, there are luddites; people opposed to new technologies or ways of working. In the rise of machinery they were afraid that the machines would steal their jobs, when photography was introduced they were afraid there was no use anymore for painting, when typewriters became accessible they were afraid kids would not learn how to write by hand anymore, with the rise of the internet they feared there would be no need to learn anything anymore, and now artificial intelligence will steal their jobs again.
Yet it all always turned out fine. Right?’

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
</center>
</div>
<div>
The rain started to clear up, though puddles of water still covered the streets. Slowly, the moon started to shine through the clouds. It had been a while.
<br><br>
'It seems like my time to go has come. We are almost done here.’
<br><br>
I didn’t want her to leave me just yet. After dumping all this on me, what was I supposed do? I decided to ask her.
<br><br>
‘Well,’ she started, ‘I hope to have enlightened you, and that you look at the world from time to time with an eye of science fiction.’
She handed me a round object.
<br><br>
‘Hereby I give you the ‘Eye of Sci-Fi’, with it you can look at the world from a science fiction perspective. Imagine where advancing technology could be taking us, and how to engage and interact with it. To look at history like Harari does: “imagine for yourself...some altogether new creation. This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course, this is not total freedom - we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”  Start using science fiction, not to predict to future, but to actively and creatively engage with technology.
I cannot definitively say whether technology is good or bad, because it is neither. Just like humans are not inherently good or bad. It is wholly dependent on how we engage with it.
Do not forget that you are on your way to becoming a fully equipped cyborg, there is not much you can do about it and maybe you are already there. No need to be afraid, for it does not have to be a bad thing. You are somewhere on the scale, with on the left side being 100% human and on the most right side being 100% cyborg. Be aware to not let technology take control of your life. 
It is important to remember that a cyborg, as Donna Haraway redefined it in the 1985 is “a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction”  in her Manifesto for Cyborgs.
You cannot be cyborg without also being human, and every human has a bit of cyborgness in them. They are not mutually exclusive; they go hand in hand. You cannot be one without the other. The only thing you have to watch out for is not to sell your soul on the way.
And to conclude with one last quote from Carlyle:
<br><br><i>
But though Mechanism, wisely contrived, has done much for man in a social and moral point of view, we cannot be persuaded that it has ever been the chief source of his worth or happiness.

<div>
As I looked around, I found myself surrounded by pine trees and mountains with summits covered in snow. All around misty mountains disappeared in the distance. Looking to the left, there she was, by my side again. Other people were here too, on the same path up the Mont Blanc, wearing brightly coloured jackets to protect them from the cold. I carefully climbed up the mountain, up the steep hill and across the heavily used path. I felt the wind in my hair and wind blowing crisp coldness on my skin, heard the crackling of snow underneath my feet and the chirping of birds in the trees.
Through the woods we could see the Mont Blanc, while enjoying the feeling of the morning sun upon our skin and that of her hand in mine.
<br><br>
It felt so real.
